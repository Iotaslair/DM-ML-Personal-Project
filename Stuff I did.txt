Got rid of all commas in the csv and replaced it with spaces, so in java it doesn't get messed up

Things that had semicolons I made it columnName.attributeValue

Got rid of Salary, SalaryType, CurrencySymbol because they were making extra commas for some reason throwing everything else off
Deleted respondent number
Bin salary
Replace all Na in number of monitors with Zero
Converted number of monitors to strings "One", "Two"
Deleted Country because the data isn't very useful (want to make this globally applicable)
Deleted Currency for similar reason to country
Get stats for all trees

parser for visualization
tone down print statements on printout
Bin salary 
Get rid of respondent number and other possibly unique values

Got rid of all commas in the csv and replaced it with spaces, so in java it doesn't get messed up
Changed Version control "I don't use version control" to "NA"

Created functions to calculate the mean score
Got rid of Salary, SalaryType, CurrencySymbol because it complicated the data unnecessarily
Binned converedSalary
Wrote function that checks if examples is empty correctly
Wrote function that limits the number of levels down you can go
Calculates information content right by using the right level of base

Java To Do:
Write visualizer
Random trees/bagging (I think that's the name)
K-Fold testing 


Python To Do:
Bin salary and others/ bin salary harder   				skipping
Make Job satisfaction and career satisfaction numbers
Install GraphViz
K-Fold cross validation
ID3
Bagging
