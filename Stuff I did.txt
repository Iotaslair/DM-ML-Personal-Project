Got rid of columns that deal with assessing job aspects, job benefits, email priorities at the job, AdsAgreeDisagree1, AdsAgreeDisagree2, AdsAgreeDisagree3, AdsActions, AdsPriorities1, AdsPriorities2, AdsPriorities3, AdsPriorities4, AdsPriorities5, AdsPriorities6, AdsPriorities7, questions if you like/recommend/want tools for StackOverflow, surveyTooLong, SurveyEasy
Got rid of all commas in the csv and replaced it with spaces, so in java it doesn't get messed up
Replaced things with NA in them with columnName.NA so the code that does preprocessing works
The list for the above is DevType, CommunicationTools, EducationTypes, SelfTaughtTypes, HackathonReasons, LanguageWorkedWith, LanguageDesireNextYear, DatabaseWorkedWith, DatabaseDesireNextYear, PlatformWorkedWith, PlatformDesireNextYear, FrameworkWorkedWith, FrameworkDesireNextYear, IDE, Methodology, VersionControl, AdBlockerReasons, ErgonomicDevices, Gender, SexualOrientation, RaceEthnicity
Things that had semicolons I made it columnName.NA  . Which does have the weird consequence of making columnName.columnName.NA in the CSV but that's fine because the algorithm will solve this problem
Changed Version control "I don't use version control" to "NA"
Got rid of Salary, SalaryType, CurrencySymbol because they were making extra commas for some reason throwing everything else off

Stuff to do:
Bagging (build tons of simple models) (random forest in book)
parser for visualization
tone down print statements on printout
Bin salary 
Get rid of respondent number and other possibly unique values

Got rid of all commas in the csv and replaced it with spaces, so in java it doesn't get messed up
Changed Version control "I don't use version control" to "NA"
Created functions to calculate the mean score
Got rid of Salary, SalaryType, CurrencySymbol because it complicated the data unnecessarily
Binned converedSalary
Wrote function that checks if examples is empty correctly
Wrote function that limits the number of levels down you can go
Calculates information content right by using the right level of base

To Do:
Write visualizer
Random trees/bagging (I think that's the name)
K-Fold testing 


To Do:
Bin salary and others/ bin salary harder
Install GraphViz
